  <p>For years, celebrities have had an influence on social and political matters in society, which is why people turn to them when there is a change that needs to be made.</p>

  <p>“When it comes to a community crisis, I think most people want their idols to speak on their behalf...especially because their platforms are usually a lot larger than ours and they can reach many more people,” said Jasmine Murray, owner and CEO of Milan360 Strategies.</p>

  <p>It is just like a famous quote from the movie “Spider-Man” says, “with great power comes great responsibility” and with the amount of possible followers anyone can gain on any given social media app, it is definitely something that reigns true.</p>

  <p>Presently, the most followed person on Instagram is soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo with 228 million followers. The second most followed person is singer Ariana Grande who has 193 million followers and the third most followed person is actor Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) who has 189 million followers.</p>

  <p>According to https://www.omnicoreagency.com/, there are a total of 1 billion users on instagram and over 500 million people use the app daily.</p>

  <p>These three celebrities have all used their massive platforms to speak out on relevant issues. For example, Ronaldo posted on March 20 about staying safe during the coronavirus. On May 29, Grande posted about the Black Lives Matter movement and on June 2, Johnson did the same.</p>

  <p>All three of them received an average of over 2 million likes on their posts. This means they all have a long reach that can get to many people from all over the world.</p>

  <p>Milan Mobley, CEO & senior publicist of Umanagement Public Relations, said that celebrities hold so much power that when world leaders aren’t doing what they are supposed to, people in society know that they can turn to celebrities to get them to speak up and enact change.</p>

  <p>For instance, with police brutality and racism at the forefront of the United States’ issues, celebrities have used their influence to support the cause when it seemed as though world leaders weren’t.</p>

  <p>In a demonstration of solidarity, celebrities like actor Kendrick Sampson,  have not only been posting on social media, but have also been protesting, marching, speaking on television and more.</p>

  <p>“Some celebrities have used their platform in a powerful way by calling out other celebrities and even large corporations who have refused to ‘put their money where their mouth is’ for so many years,” said Murray. “I love that so many people are charging large companies to add more Brown and Black people to their executive boards and more. This only happened because celebrities decided to speak out against the unjust actions that take place in their industry every day and have been taking place for years.,” she continued.</p>

  <p>Celebrities' opinions carry more weight and can impact a wider audience than a regular person can, therefore, allowing more people to follow their lead. In turn, this puts pressure on people, companies, and others to change their behavior because they know that celebrities can get their fans to stop buying into them.</p>

  <p>When determining who is deemed a celebrity, it all boils down to the people and the media.</p>

  <p>“The industry can find someone and add their strategy to provide the context and likeable features that consumers like. The public has the authority to determine what they like, what they want to see, and ultimately determine who has celebrity status,” Murray said.</p>

  <p>With social media being a huge powerhouse in our culture today, celebrities are made and discovered much easier than before.</p>

  <p>Social media enhances visibility and gives anyone the opportunity to be seen.</p>

  <p>There are several positives and negatives to celebrities influencing society.</p>

  <p>“The positive is that they have large platforms to make change, and to bring light on to certain issues. The negative is that not all of them are capable of properly articulating their emotions and feelings in a way that it is positively received to the public,” said Mobley.</p>

  <p>Murray said, “when a celebrity irresponsibly tries to speak on behalf of a particular community and fails to communicate what needs to be translated for our best interest, it sets us back.”</p>

  <p>Sometimes, celebrities get it wrong and face backlash from the public.</p>

  <p>For instance, Terry Crews has been receiving a lot of heat for his most recent tweets about the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

  <p>He has said things such as, “I’m a human rights activist- not a human wrongs activist” and “If you are a child of God, you are my brother and sister. I have family of every race, creed and ideology. We must ensure #blacklivesmatter doesn’t morph into #blacklivesbetter,” and this was not received well by the Black community.</p>

  <p>People believed that he was making the Black community look bad and that his tweets are making the movement go backwards all while trying to make the white community feel safe during the movement.</p>

  <p>Yet, isolated incidents such as these haven’t stopped people from believing that celebrities can still do good when they speak up for a cause.
  “I don’t think there is anything wrong with allowing celebrities to help with being a strong voice to our society, especially if it is to help spread positivity and a strong message, one with meaning and passion. I think what I would like to see is more people in general holding themselves accountable and responsible for things that they want to see changed and not just ‘wait’ and stand by for someone such as a celebrity to do so. People need to start becoming their own advocate for change,” said Monica Smothers, multiplatform programming specialist for NBC.</p>

  <p>“Regular people have to understand their influence, the same way celebrities have to understand their influence, and we all have to make decisions wisely in terms of who we give power to,” said Murray.</p>

  <p>It is believed by some that we can learn from those who have an influence in our society.</p>

  <p>“What we can learn from celebrities who have an influence in our society is to keep on fighting for what you believe in no matter how long it takes. A lot of celebrities have stories of how they became a part of the industry and most didn’t have silver spoons handed to them.” Smothers said.</p>

  <p>“In fact, a lot of them were probably at one time fighting to be heard, seen, and just taken seriously all for the simple fact of doing something that they love. That is something that I hope one day more people will learn to adapt to. Rome wasn’t built in one day and neither will things change in a blink of an eye. Patience is the key,” Smothers said.</p>
